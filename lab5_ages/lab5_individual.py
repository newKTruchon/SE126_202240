#Program Prompt:
#Re-write the Week #5 Class Lab but instead of searching for a personâ€™s name, search for their birthday.  If the person is found, reprint their entire record to the console.  The program should allow the user to search for as many birthdays as they want. The program should also print a statement telling the user how many iterations of the search loop the program went through before finding (or not finding) the requested person.

#------------Variable Dictionary-----------------------------------------------------
#records            record count

#fName              first name index 1
#bday               date of birth index 2
#answer             input answer. start of while loop. answer == "y"
#search             input bday to be searched as string 
#search_count       search counter in loop. resets after each new search
#found              search found within record
#date_object        birthday index converted into datetime format
