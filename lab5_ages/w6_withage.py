#Erick Cordon Lab 6

#Prompt: Re-write the Week #5 Class Lab but instead of searching for a personâ€™s name, search for their birthday.  If the person is found, reprint their entire record to the console.  The program should allow the user to search for as many birthdays as they want. The program should also print a statement telling the user how many iterations of the search loop the program went through before finding (or not finding) the requested person.

#Varriable Definitions:

#lastname = [] empty list for last name
#firstname = [] empty list for first name
#dob = [] empty list for date of birth
#records = 0 counting var 
#search_count = 0 counts how many searches are processed

#bday = datetime.strptime(dob[found], "%m/%d/%Y") #STUDENTS DATE AND TIME
#tday = datetime.now() CURRENT DATE AND TIME

#age = tday - bday#(todays dates - found persons birthdate) THIS IS USED TO GET AGE FROM DATETIME
#total = (age.total_seconds() /(3.141592653589793 * 10** 7)) # THIS IS TO THE TOTAL YEARS /.totalsecond converts the datetime to seconds /seconds divded by (pi * 10 to the 7th power)/

#age_total = int(total) #prevents from total rounding up
