#Lab 5
#Keegan Preston

#Program Prompt: Re-write the Week #5 Class Lab but instead of searching for a personâ€™s name, search for their birthday.  If the person is found, reprint their entire record to the console.  The program should allow the user to search for as many birthdays as they want. The program should also print a statement telling the user how many iterations of the search loop the program went through before finding (or not finding) the requested person
