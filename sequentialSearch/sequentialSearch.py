#WEEK 6 DAY 1: Sequential Search

#Sequential Search: Sequential search means to search through an entire list (array), starting at the first record and looking through every one until the last, when looking for something. 

#For Loops --> allow us to process every record in an list (for index in range(0, records) --> this applies to every record in the list)

#If Statements --> allow us to "search": compare a value in the list we are looking through against the value(s) we are looking for. 

#we are utilizing binary.txt for this demo
#       FIELD0     #FIELD1     FIELD2      FIELD3
#       ID nums    Names       Age         Color  

#VARIABLE DICTIONARY
