#WEEK 9: FINAL REVIEW

#This review demo will cover all major topics from SE126.  It utilizes: 'finalReview_text.txt'
#Documentation has been added post demo to enhance understandig of the code

#in this review program, you will:
#   1 - connect to a file and import its data into lists
#               1a - the lists are UNEVEN so a filter system must be used
#               1b - count the total number of people in the file
#   2 - process the lists to print the original data to the console
#   3 - process the lists to find:
#               3a - the youngest person in the list
#               3b - the oldest person in the list
#               3c - the average age of the people in the list
#   4 - a search option to search for id codes within the list
#           ** utilize menu '1. Sequential 2. Binary 3. Exit' that is printed from a function that returns the user's selection choice
#               4A - allow user to search multiple time
#               4a - sequential search will be performed w/ output to visualize search
#               4b - binary search will be performed w/ output to visualize search
